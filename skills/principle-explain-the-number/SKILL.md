# Explain the number

A measured number is a claim about work. Check that the work
happened and that you know what limited it.

Name the limiter. Which core, lock, disk, network link, or load
generator kept the number from being twice as good? Get it from a
profile or counters taken during a run, then point at the source
that owns it. Reading code and guessing does not name a limiter.

Rule out the other readings, each with evidence: errors counted as
fast responses, cached or skipped work, a path that never ran, one
side left on default settings, noise larger than the gap, a piece
too small to move the end-to-end result.

Keep the run count, the spread, and the limiter next to the number,
in the notes or a linked file.

For performance numbers, run **benchmark-checklist**. For an eval,
ask whether every trial did the task and whether the gap holds
across trials and models.

Signs this was skipped: a number reported without how many runs,
how much they varied, or what bounded them. Or a claimed saving that
exceeds the whole cost of the part you changed.

**prove-on-the-artifact** checks that an output is real. This checks
that a measurement means what you say.
